# 1inch DAO Guidelines


# Introduction

  

These guidelines are dynamic documents that change in tandem with the DAO. They are not only a static text. As the DAO's compass, these guidelines help the DAO stay true to its goals, maintain inclusivity and openness, and manoeuvre through the constantly shifting DeFi environment. Since the 1inch DAO is committed to maintaining a transparent operational structure, it will continue to be a leading and significant force in the DeFi market.

## 1. The Guidelines

The 1inch DAO Guidelines serve to guide the operations of the 1inch DAO. They define the DAO's purpose, values, processes, responsibilities, working groups & related facets, and define the rules and recommended guidelines to ensure transparency, accountability, and efficiency in the DAO. The Guidelines are a strategic device for alignment of the Community to embody as much operational and procedural resilience into the governance process. The Guidelines also prescribe principles for governing the relationship of the 1inch DAO, the 1inch Foundation and the Community – clearly defining their respective scope of responsibilities.

## 2. Definitions

## 5. The 1inch DAO

**5.1. Purpose of the 1inch DAO**
The 1inch DAO is a Community of the 1INCH tokenholders that governs the 1inch Network through a set of on-chain smart contracts. The 1inch DAO also aims to expand the 1inch Network ecosystem, by incentivizing and fostering ecosystem governance, enhancements, integrations, research and innovation, defined as the DAO’s in-scope activities in 4.3.2 above. All participants in the DAO are working towards a common goal of ensuring that the 1inch Network protocols and 1INCH, which are decentralized, owned and governed by the DAO, remain innovative, competitive and resilient to market and political volatility.

  

## 5.2. 1inch DAO Values

**5.2.1.**  **Decentralization**. Governance in the 1inch Network should be open to all Members. Decision-making should be driven by the collective.

**5.2.2.**  **Accessibility and Immutability**. Governance  should be transparent and user-friendly, clearly defined and accessible. Governance processes should maximize immutability to manipulation and centralized interference. Governance design should aim to reduce the threshold for meaningful participation sufficiently to allow 1inch DAO to tap into the collective intelligence of the Community.
 
**5.2.3.**  **Ecosystem Development**. The 1inch DAO should make aggressive efforts towards fostering innovation in the DeFi ecosystem, as well as encourage other forms of technical innovation.
    
**5.2. 4.**  **Humanitarian-focus**. The 1inch DAO is committed to humanitarian causes and initiatives that provide aid or betterment for humanity.
   
**5.2.5.**  **Security**. In engaging in protocol governance or any other major network activity, the security and safety of the 1inch Network and the Community must be given the utmost priority. The 1inch DAO should constantly implement industry best practices in terms of security.
  
**5.2.6.**  **Diligence**. 1inch DAO should invest resources into ensuring that 1inch Network and the Community at all times operate based on responsible decisions, diligent assessment and analysis, regulatory compliance and professional advice, when necessary.
    
**5.2.7.**  **Inclusivity**. The 1inch DAO should remain open and accessible to all willing participants regardless of their background—cultural, social, economic, etc. Diversity should be fostered.
    

## 5.3. Membership

**5.3.1.** **1INCH Token Holders**

Anyone may participate in the DAO’s discussions. However, only persons who hold 1INCH or its wrapped tokens may vote on proposals (“Members”).

**5.3.2.** **Guidelines regarding Members Conduct**

Members commit to abide by the following guidelines when engaging in activities, participating in discussions, or interacting with other members in the DAO through the Forum, 1inch Discord, 1inch Telegram, or any other approved channel.


 - **Value**
The principle is to ‘create value for the discussion’. All inputs from Members are welcome as long as they are valuable. Members should avoid duplicating topics, discussions or proposals.

 - **Offering Feedback**
The principle is to ‘criticize ideas, not people’. Members should always engage in civil discourse. They are free to disagree with ideas but in a tolerant and civil manner.

 - **Respect**
Members should abstain from making posts that are abusive, discriminatory, racist, sexist, hateful, illegal or offensive in any way. This also entails respecting the privacy of others.

 - **Keeping Tidy**
Members are encouraged to leverage the Forum tools to keep discussions focused, categorized and effective. Members should strive to keep the Forum clean.

 - **Official Language**
All posts on the Forum should be made in English. Members are however free to make posts in other languages when using other 1inch platforms with multi-language support such as the 1inch Discord and Telegram.


 - **Content Manipulation**
Members should not engage in spamming, sock-puppet accounts, brigading, ban evasion, poll manipulation, sybil attacks, “like” manipulation, or other forms of platform abuse or content manipulation.

 - **Member Accounts**
The principle is to ‘use one account per person’. A member should only control one account at a time. Simultaneously operating multiple accounts is considered a form of sybil attack and is forbidden.

 - **Impersonation**
Members should not impersonate individuals or entities. Anonymity/pseudonymity does not necessarily imply impersonation. The key factor is an intent to mislead others.

**Disclaimer**: Members should acknowledge that the legal and regulatory status of virtual currencies, blockchain technologies, decentralized finance, governance, and DAOs is uncertain, rapidly changing, and highly dependent on the jurisdiction, regulatory apprehensiveness of such technologies, and a multitude of other factors. The Members should be aware of the risks associated with such an unpredictable legal environment. Recent developments in the regulatory approach suggest that some regulators may take a rather drastic approach in the assessment of the status of the DAO and its members. The Members shall acknowledge the risks mentioned above, assess each of the DAOs and their actions respectively, assume responsibility for it, and seek professional counsel whenever possible or required.

  
  
  

## 5.4. 1inch DAO Working Groups

**5.4.1. Setting up working groups**
A working group can be set up or dissolved by making a proposal to the DAO and following the proposal process mentioned in 5.6.1.

## 5.5. 1inch DAO Treasury

**5.5.1.  Overview**
The 1inch DAO Treasury is the pool of funds under the direct domain and ownership of the DAO. The Treasury may be used to fund initiatives, products, development, events, and activities of the Community.

The primary 1inch DAO Treasury is [Safe](https://app.safe.global/balances?safe=eth:0x7951c7ef839e26F63DA87a42C9a87986507f1c07) smart contract wallet with multi-signature (multisig) functionality on the Ethereum mainnet. 12 multisig signers have initially been selected by the 1inch Foundation from the core contributor team and other well-known projects, such as [Synthetix](https://synthetix.io/), [Opium](https://opium.network/), [NEAR protocol](https://near.org/), and [zkSync](https://zksync.io/), to name a few. These signers can veto malicious transactions with a 7/12 approval quorum.

  
**5.5.2.  DAO Treasury Principles**
The management and use of the DAO Treasury shall adhere to the following principles:

(a)  **Efficient Resource Allocation**. Funds from the DAO Treasury should be aimed at the development and growth of the DAO, network, and Community.
    
(b) **Accountability**. Each grant from the DAO Treasury should be accounted for by grantees or funded working groups. The CCommunity acts as the overall and collective accountability enforcer and demands evidence of results and details on the uses of funds.
    
( c ).  **Trust and Transparency**. Each grant from the DAO Treasury should be provided solely to the contributors who have established trust. The purpose and motivation for each grant, as well as the distribution of such funds, should be known and reported to the Community.
    
(d) **Prevention**. TheDAO should follow a system of checks and balances that prevents abuse, misuse, and embezzlement of treasury funds, including giving preference to result-driven projects, retroactive funding, milestone funding, etc.
    

  

## 5.6. 1inch DAO Governance

**5.6.1. Traditional Governance**
Traditional Governance consists of 1inch DAO consensus for larger protocol changes that are to be discussed in the 1inch DAO Forum and eventually formalized into a proposal (1IP or Fast-Track).

**Disclaimer**: The Members acknowledge that 1INCH token is a governance tool and shall be used responsibly by each member to express their wishes, initiatives and thoughts with regard to 1inch DAO and the possibilities it presents. The Members should not exploit 1INCH token for other purposes, including for personal gain and should not perceive it as a financial, trading or investment instrument whatsoever. The Members should rely solely on their personal judgment as to the financial, regulatory and other implications of the access and use of 1INCH token, and seek professional counsel whenever possible or required.

**5.6.2.  1IP Proposal Lifecycle**
    
A 1inch Improvement Proposal (1IP) is a standardized proposal framework that is utilized in the 1inch DAO governance process to propose and implement changes to the 1inch Network after it has been subject to voting by Members. The 1IP proposal lifecycle is as follows:

**Phase 1: Discussion**
This is the idea-vetting stage where Community members engage in conversation about potential improvements to the 1inch Network. Anyone can participate in this phase, and it occurs entirely off-chain, specifically, on the 1inch DAO Forum. Community members are encouraged to abide by the Guidelines regarding Members Conduct when participating in this phase.

Duration: Open-ended.

**Phase 2: 1IP Formalization**
Here, the idea is formalized into a 1IP that includes all of the criteria specified in the [1inch Improvement Proposal (1IP) Template](https://gov.1inch.io/t/1ip-0-1inch-improvement-proposal-template/1972). All 1IPs must have the following components (refer to the template for a detailed breakdown):

-   Simple Summary (Not more than 280 characters)
    
-   Abstract
    
-   Motivation
    
-   Specification
    
-   Rationale
    
-   Consideration
    
Once the 1IP has been drafted, the author must post it on the 1inch governance forum and use the tag: Phase-2.

While the 1IP is in a draft state, the 1IP author is free to make modifications to the proposal based on feedback from the Community’s review.

Duration: Open-ended.

  

**Phase 3: 1IP Temperature Check**

At any point during Phase 2, the author may finalize the 1IP by initiating a temperature check. To do this, the author must change the tag of the forum post to Phase-3, and add a forum poll to gauge the 1inch DAO’s sentiment.

1IPs should only be progressed to Phase 3 once the author has considered all Community comments and believes the 1IP is prepared for incorporation. Phase 3 represents the final proposal. Other than correcting errata, 1IPs in Phase 3 may not be edited.

The poll must be open for 5 days and only have the following options:

-   Yes (in favour of this proposal)
    
-   No (against this proposal)
    
-   Abstain (neither in favour or against)
    
**Note**: This process is irreversible, i.e., an author may not revert a 1IP back to Stage 2 if it fails the temperature check vote.

Duration: Exactly 5 days.

**Proposal Risk Review**
The legal environment around blockchain technologies and virtual assets is constantly evolving. The unpredictability of the regulation may cause unforeseen risks and may subject the DAO to various legal requirements. To mitigate any possibility of legal non-compliance, the DAO commits to request an independent review of each proposal from the independent legal counsel engaged by the DAO, in the following cases:

1.  Whenever the proposal introduces a new product or feature, or a substantial change to the existing product or feature, especially, where such change or new development involves changes in financial and/or contractual liabilities of the DAO, or financial or contractual changes in the relationship of the DAO with the users of the products, DAO members, etc;
    
2.  Whenever the proposal raises the possibility that the regulations or law of any jurisdiction may be applied;
    
3.  Whenever the Community indicates and signals during the discussion that such a proposal raises reasonable doubts as to the legal implications;
    
4.  Whenever a risk review is requested by any 1inch DAO member of the ;
    
5.  Whenever a risk review is recommended by the engaged legal counsel (if applicable).
    
It is to be understood by the members that such risk review is not a guarantee against any legal implications or proceeding and each member retains personal responsibility to assess each proposal, its consequences, participating in the vote of such proposal or any activity of the DAO in general.


**Phase 4: Snapshot Vote**

All 1IPs are confirmed, or rejected, by the 1inch DAO via an off-chain Snapshot vote. The Snapshot vote must link to the results of the successful Phase-3 forum poll and include the full text of the finalized 1IP. Anyone can initiate the Snapshot vote as long as all requirements of Phase 3 are met and it passes the temperature-check vote.

The vote must be open for 7 days and have the following options:

-   Yes (in favor of this proposal)
    
-   No (against this proposal)
    
A minimum of 100,000 Voting Weight is required to create a Snapshot vote.

For a vote to be considered successful, both of the following must be met:

-   A minimum quorum of 10 million weighted votes must be cast.
    
-   A majority of the votes must be Yes (in favor of the proposal)
    
Duration: Exactly 7 days.

  
**Phase 5: Implementation**
After the Snapshot voting period has concluded, the results will be posted on the 1IPs section of the governance documentation site. If the proposal has passed, it will move from the Active to the Passed category. Unsuccessful proposals will move to the Not-Passed category.

[SafeSnap](https://github.com/gnosis/zodiac-module-reality) allows for on-chain execution of the off-chain Snapshot vote by using the [reality.eth](https://reality.eth.link/) oracle. The reality.eth’s bonded escalation period lasts at least 72 hours (this period is reset if the resolution is challenged). The SafeSnap process officially concludes once a full 72-hour escalation period has elapsed without challenge.

There is an additional 72-hour period of time between the SafeSnap resolution and the incorporation of said 1IP into the protocol – this is known as the Timelock. During the Timelock period, the 1inch DAO Treasury multisig owners will have the ability to veto malicious transactions with a 7/12 approval quorum.

For the 1IPs requiring off-chain actions, the implementation will vary on a case-by-case basis.

Duration: 6 days minimum.

  

**5.6.3. Fast-Track Proposals**
(a)  **Scope**
Fast-Track Proposals is an alternative streamlined governance process for emergencies or urgent situations. Specifically, it is utilized under the following circumstances:

**(b)  Fast-Track Proposal Process**
The fast-track proposal process is as follows:

1.  Governance Thread for 24 hours. Whitelisted member posts a fast-track proposal on the 1inch DAO Forum with “[Fast-Track]” in the title of the thread. The thread lasts for 24 hours before moving forward to a SnapShot vote.
    
2.  SnapShot Vote for 48 hours. 1inch governance token holders will vote on the proposal via SnapShot. The duration of the vote is 48 hours.
    

**5.6.4.  Voting Process**
**(a)  Staking**
1INCH must be staked in the 1inch governance contract to participate in voting. Staking is an on-chain event in which the user temporarily locks up their 1INCH and receives st1INCH. Staking is a time-locked event with minimum and maximum lock periods of 1 month and 2 years respectively.

**Disclaimer**: The Members acknowledge that the 1INCH token is a governance tool and shall be used responsibly by each member to express their wishes, initiatives and thoughts with regard to 1inch DAO and the possibilities it presents. The Members should not exploit 1INCH token for other purposes, including for personal gain and should not perceive it as a financial, trading or investment instrument whatsoever. The Members should rely solely on their personal judgment as to the financial, regulatory and other implications of the access and use of 1INCH token, and seek professional counsel whenever possible or required.

  
**(b) Unicorn Power**
Unicorn Power (UP) or Voting Weight represents an individual's influence within the 1inch DAO governance process. UP is earned by staking 1INCH tokens. The amount of Unicorn Power held decreases over time.

**( c )  Delegation**
Individuals may delegate their UP to an address of their choice. Those who choose to delegate their voting rights to another address are known as Delegators, while those who receive delegation are known as Delegates. Members may choose to delegate their voting powers in the [Snapshot 1inch space](https://snapshot.org/#/delegate/1inch.eth), or, by interacting directly with the Snapshot delegation smart contract.

  

## **5.7. Dispute Resolution**
**5.7.1.  Dispute Resolution within the DAO**
The members and DAO will strive to resolve any off-chain dispute, controversy or claim arising regarding the DAO or its activities, by negotiation and public discussion. DAO may encourage the Community to assist in dispute resolution or create other opportunities for respectful and effective negotiations.

If a satisfactory and definitive solution is not achieved within 30 (thirty) days, DAO and its members commit to resolve all disputes via [Kleros Dispute Resolution Protocol](https://kleros.io/) by submitting the dispute to the respective Kleros Specialized Court or Kleros General Court. Parties of the dispute may appeal the decision within the mechanisms provided by the Kleros Dispute Resolution Protocol as well. The parties to the dispute are advised to agree on the law, language, appeal, and enforcement process before entering the Kleros Dispute Resolution Process.

  

## 5.8. Amendment
These guidelines can only be amended through a Governance Vote with at least 10M $Unicorn Power tokens participating.
