---

## 4. Whitelisting

### Eligibility Threshold

In order to become the Whitelisted Resolver, you must qualify for the whitelist. The whitelist is dynamically maintained based on the Unicorn Power delegation threshold. To be eligible for the whitelist, you must have received delegations equating to 5% or more of the total Unicorn Power in the network (“Eligibility Threshold”). The whitelist is a maximum limit of ten (10) resolvers.

### Dynamic Whitelist

The dynamic nature of the whitelist means that the Resolver's eligibility may evolve over time due to changes in the Unicorn Power distribution. Should you as the Resolver no longer meet the Unicorn Power delegation threshold, you may be automatically removed from the list of the Whitelisted Resolvers.

From time to time the whitelist criteria and the maximum number of resolvers on the whitelist may be modified, and such changes will be communicated to the Resolvers community in advance.

Please note that inclusion in the whitelist is not guaranteed solely by meeting the Unicorn Power delegation threshold. The Resolver shall ensure full compliance with these Terms, successfully complete the verification and registration process, as described below.

---

## 5. Compliance

### Verification

In order to become the Whitelisted Resolver, you must complete the verification procedure accessible at [1inchfoundation.synaps.me](https://1inchfoundation.synaps.me). The verification procedure aims to ensure that the Whitelisted Resolvers are safe and compliant actors.

The verification involves completing an identifying Know Your Client (KYC) / Know Your Business (KYB) questionnaire to verify your identity and determine your legal eligibility. You undertake to promptly provide all required information, including supporting documentation and other evidence, as may be reasonably requested. If you do not provide the required information and/or identifying documents, you will not be able to be whitelisted as the Resolver.

Please note that you are solely responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data provided. If any information and/or identifying documents change, you must inform the 1inch Network representative at [foundation@1inch.io](mailto:foundation@1inch.io) without delay. You may be required to complete the verification process again.

You understand that the amount of information requested to provide as part of the verification procedure may be subject to change over time and that you may at a later point in time be required to provide additional documents and/or information.

The data is collected to comply with applicable anti-money laundering, anti-terrorist financing, fraud prevention, sanctions laws, and regulations. This data is securely maintained and disclosed only when permitted by law. For more information on how your personal data is processed please read the [1inch Network Interface Privacy Policy](https://1inch.io/assets/1inch_network_privacy_policy.pdf).

### Wallet Address Screening

Publicly available information may be used to monitor potential bad actors and assess the risks associated with illicit or non-compliant activities, or other potential threats within the blockchain networks. No additional personal data is collected to perform such compliance assessment. Such risk assessment services may be provided by TRMLabs or other third parties.

### Third-party Providers

Please note that verification procedures and wallet address screening are provided by third-party providers. You acknowledge and understand that the results and outcomes lie in the sole discretion of the third-party provider. We have no control over or connection to the services of any third-party providers, thus we are not and cannot be responsible for the accuracy of the information or the services of such providers. The services of such third-party providers are governed by their respective terms of use, please read them carefully.

---

## 6. Registration

To complete the whitelisting process, the Resolver that passed the verification procedure shall undergo registration in the whitelist smart contract deployed by the 1inch Network. Please note that updates to the whitelist smart contract may occur periodically. We will reasonably ensure but have no obligation to communicate any such modifications in advance.

By registering as the Whitelisted Resolver, you acknowledge, warrant, and agree that:

- You are solely responsible for any decision to use the 1inch Fusion Mode, including assessing any and all risks related to any Fusion Order.
- You participate in the Fusion Order’s Dutch auction entirely at your own risk and there are no representations or warranties as to the code security or ongoing availability of the Fusion Mode or that your access will be uninterrupted, timely, or secure at all times.
- You accept that any fees, costs, or expenses associated with your use of the 1inch Fusion Mode are your responsibility unless otherwise specified.

- You understand that any violation of these Terms may result in your removal from the list of the Whitelisted Resolvers without prior notice.

The Resolver shall ensure full and continuous compliance with these Terms. We reserve the right to remove the Resolver from the whitelist if the Whitelisted Resolver fails to comply with any provision of the 1inch Fusion Mode Terms.

---

## 7. Permissioned Proxy

The 1inch Fusion Mode allows eligible Resolvers to unite their Unicorn Power to meet the eligibility criteria for registering the Whitelisted Resolver that will act as a permissioned proxy, facilitating collection of data from Resolvers participating in filling the Fusion Order. The Resolver chosen to act as the permissioned proxy shall undergo a whitelisting procedure according to these Terms.

Contributing to filling the Fusion Order by the Permissioned Proxy is subject to compliance with the 1inch Fusion Mode Terms. By registering as the Whitelisted Resolver, the Permissioned Proxy is obliged to ensure that each Resolver contributing in any capacity to fill the Fusion Orders by the Permissioned Proxy complies with these Terms, including the eligibility criteria as set forth in Section 3 of these Terms.

Should any Resolver involved fail to comply with these Terms, such failure may be deemed as the failure by the Permissioned Proxy to comply with these Terms and may result in the Permissioned Proxy’s removal from the whitelist.

The Resolvers acknowledge that their participation in the Permissioned Proxy is subject to arrangements defined by the Resolvers involved. We expressly disclaim any influence, control, or obligation over the decisions, functions and/or results of the Permissioned Proxy’s operations. We assume no liability for collaborative decisions made by the Resolvers within the Permissioned Proxy framework.

---

## 8. Use of the 1inch Fusion Mode

This Section outlines specific provisions regarding the Resolver’s interaction with the 1inch Fusion Mode, however, not exhaustive. Other terms related to the use of the 1inch Fusion Mode can be found in the other sections of these Terms. Please ensure that you thoroughly review the entire Terms for comprehensive understanding.

### Cross-Chain Functionality (1inch Fusion+)

This subsection describes specific terms with respect to the cross-chain functionality that operates on top of the 1inch’s existing intent-based protocols, facilitated by the 1inch Escrow Contracts, as defined above.

To initiate a transaction using the cross-chain functionality, the Maker initiates a Fusion Order by signing and issuing the order using the hash of a secret value sent to the 1inch Network, signaling their intent to make a cross-chain swap. Execution of all deposit and withdrawal operations within the cross-chain functionality is performed by the Taker.

Cross-chain functionality also introduces safety deposit mechanics and recovery phase as a precautionary measure. When a Resolver deposits assets into the escrow contract, they must include an additional amount of the native asset of the chain (the “Safety Deposit”). The Safety Deposit is allocated to the executor of any subsequent withdrawal or cancellation transactions.

In cases where assets are withdrawn on the source chain escrow, but canceled on the destination chain escrow, the Resolver must return the Maker's funds on the source chain. This requirement is monitored by the 1inch technical team, as defined below, to additionally notify the Resolvers of the required actions. The Resolver shall perform these actions without any delay. Refusal to do so is subject to the Restriction Measures, as described below.

### Priority Fee Limitations

The 1inch Fusion Mode employs limits on the Priority Fees, including through the predicate (“Fusion Order Predicate”). The following limitations are applicable, irrespective of the use of the Fusion Order Predicate:

- For blocks where the Base Fee is <10.6 gwei, the Priority Fee is capped at 70% of the Base Fee;
- For blocks with the Base Fee ranges between 10.6 gwei and 104.1 gwei, the Priority Fee is capped at 50% of the Base Fee;
- For blocks where the Base Fee is >104.1 gwei, the Priority Fee is capped at 65% of the Base Fee.

### Restriction Measures

Any action aimed at circumventing the Priority Fee Limitation, intentionally altering the transaction order within the block, and/or otherwise abusing the Fusion Orders filling process, constitutes a breach of these Terms, including, but not limited to:

- Bypassing the Priority Fee Limitations as defined above;
- Making direct payments to the Block Builder’s coinbase address (i.e. block.coinbase.transfer(amount));
- Deliberate actions to manipulate transaction order within the block; and/or
- Bundling with non-related transactions.

Given the evolving nature of the 1inch Fusion Mode, this list is not intended to be exhaustive. Any breach identified by the technical team responsible for maintaining the 1inch Fusion Mode (the “1inch technical team”) will be subject to the outlined restriction measures. We reserve the right to determine and address any breach at our sole discretion, enforcing the restrictions accordingly.

Upon the first breach identified, the Resolver will immediately receive a warning notice sent from the analytics team supporting the 1inch Fusion Mode (the “1inch analytics team”) via the previously provided by the Resolver contacts and other available private means of communication. Subsequent violations shall result in restrictions on processing the Fusion Orders within the 1inch Fusion Mode based on the frequency of such breaches. The restriction measures mean blocking the Resolver from processing the Fusion Orders for the specific period determined by the cumulative count of breaches as of the date of the latest breach identified as follows:

- Upon a second breach, the Resolver shall be blocked from processing the Fusion Orders for a duration of one (1) day;
- Upon a third breach - for a duration of seven (7) days;
- Upon a fourth breach - for a duration of thirty (30) days;
- Upon a fifth breach - for a duration of three-hundred sixty-five (365) days.

The restriction measures are enforced by the representative of the 1inch technical team. In case of any subsequent breach, the following team will promptly notify the Resolver regarding the applicable restriction measures via the previously provided by the Resolver contacts and other available private means of communication.

We reserve the right to determine the fact, count, and sequence of breaches at our sole discretion. The count of breaches begins consecutively starting from the date of the first violation identified. The restrictions shall be effective immediately upon their technical implementation.

---

## 9. The Whitelisted Resolver’s Exit

As the Whitelisted Resolver, you have the right to voluntarily exit from the 1inch Fusion Mode at any time for any reason by contacting us. If you choose to exit, you shall inform the 1inch Network support team at [support@1inch.io](mailto:support@1inch.io) about your intention to exit within fourteen (14) days prior to the intended exit date. If you act as the Permissioned Proxy you are required to notify those Resolvers involved in the Permissioned Proxy about your exit within the same 14-day period.

The exit date is determined as 14 days following the next day of notification to the 1inch Network support team. For instance, if the Whitelisted Resolver informs the 1inch Network support team about the intention to exit on September 1st, the Resolver's Whitelisting status will be revoked on September 15th.

Upon the exit date, the Whitelisted Resolver's functionality within the 1inch Fusion Mode will be disabled, and the Resolver’s whitelisting status will be revoked. Consequently, such Resolver will no longer be considered an active participant within the 1inch Fusion Mode.

### Incentive Programs (Farms)

In the event of the Whitelisted Resolver’s exit or any other case when the Resolver’s whitelist status is terminated, the Resolver’s commitment within the farm remains binding according to the initially defined timing schedule. Therefore, in case of exiting from the 1inch Fusion Mode or experiencing whitelist status termination, the exiting Resolver shall retain the created incentives in the farm. Such Resolver must ensure that the Delegates who have previously delegated their voting power to that Resolver are able to claim the incentives from the Resolver at any time after such Resolver's exit.

### Notification on Non-Active Status

Information about the non-active status of the resolver will be prominently displayed on the 1inch Fusion Mode interface. The Delegates are strongly advised to refrain from using non-active resolvers. Instead, the Delegates are encouraged to consider and interact with the list of active Whitelisted Resolvers. Resolvers should be a pro-active part of such notifications.

---

## 10. Exclusive Resolver API

The Resolver may be exclusively selected to fill the Fusion Order at the beginning of the Fusion Order’s Dutch auction as vetted by 1inch from time to time. In order to benefit from the Exclusive Resolver API functionality, the Resolver shall provide the 1inch technical team with the Resolver’s API endpoint developed in accordance with the Exclusive Resolver API documentation and/or any necessary credentials provided by the 1inch technical team.

The Resolver’s use of the Exclusive Resolver API functionality is subject to the Service Level Agreement detailed in Annex A of these Terms.

The Resolver hereby grants 1inch with a limited, non-exclusive, world-wide, non-sublicensable and non-transferable license to the Resolver's API endpoint solely for the purpose of and to the extent necessary for the use of the Exclusive API Resolver functionality, as set forth herein, if applicable.

---

## 11. Incentive Programs

From time to time we may introduce various incentive programs designed to incentivize active participation by the Resolvers. The specific details and terms of each incentive program, including eligibility criteria, and duration, will be communicated in advance. We reserve the right to modify, update, or terminate these incentive programs at its sole discretion with prior notice.
